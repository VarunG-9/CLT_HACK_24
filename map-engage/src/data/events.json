But there are many ways to tackle this anxiety and learn to deliver a memorable presentation.\n\u00a0\nSpeaking in front of people is a skill, not an innate ability.

Nonverbal communications are the most challenging aspect for people to improve when public speaking. In this workshop, we will discuss the most important nonverbal tips for public speaking.\nThis information will significantly assist you in communication because nonverbal communication and verbal communication are the two core components of public speaking. While verbal communication can be improved with extensive practice, nonverbal communication directly impacts the audience\u2019s ability to comprehend the message. Imagine, if you see a public speaker who delivers their point coherently and comprehensively, what will you think if they keep looking down or sideways, and put their hands behind their back? Between verbal and non-verbal communication, it\u2019s the latter who speaks louder. Think about it. By paying close attention to your nonverbal communication, you can improve the delivery of your message.\n\u00a0\nRegister Here\n\u00a0\nPresenter: Dr. Daryl L.

    "description": "This workshop is eligible for the 2024 Niner Career Challenge!\nMost people feel a little intimidated about networking, and this is especially true when you are new to a culture. Are you familiar with the saying, \"it's not what you know, it's who you know\"? In the US, connections with people carry a lot of weight when looking for a job. This is why networking is a fundamental skill for launching and furthering your career. However, when we hear the word \"networking,\" we often think of \"doing lunch,\" selling ourselves, and handing out business cards. If we changed the word to \u201cconnecting,\u201d we might feel better about it. Your job search begins with the people you know! Never underestimate their knowledge and influence. Most people are enthusiastic about connecting and see it as mutually beneficial.\nElona Ellis serves as the Assistant Director for the Peer Professionals and Career Coach for the Technology, Data and Analytics career community\nRegister here\n\nHosted by: The Center for Graduate Life and Learning\n\nAdditional Information can be found at: https://ninerengage.charlotte.edu/event/10176996"
